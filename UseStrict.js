// The purpose of "use strict" is to indicate that the code should be executed in "strict mode".
// With strict mode, you can not, for example, use undeclared variables.
// Strict mode makes it easier to write "secure" JavaScript.
// Strict mode changes previously accepted "bad syntax" into real errors.

"use strict";
// x = 3.14;             This will cause an error (x is not defined)



myFunction();

function myFunction() {
   // y = 3.14;          This will also cause an error (y is not defined)
}
